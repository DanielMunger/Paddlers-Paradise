        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Originally from <em>Carbondale, Colorado</em>, I now reside in <em>Portland, Oregon</em> where I attended <strong>Epicodus.</strong> My hope is to work in Development with an emphasis in Data Analysis and Security. Specifically, I am interested in clean energy or clean technology. Another possible sector to work in would be security. The ultimate goal is to find an industry where I can make a positive impact on the people and enviornment around me.<br>   Growing up in Colorado, I was always outside, enjoying my surroundings through numerous outdoor sports. The outdoors acurately reflect who I am as a person and have shaped my expierences throughout my formative years. Skiing, kayaking, climbing, fishing, hiking, and general activity kept me entertained year-round. I've yet to explore much of the PNW but my general sense is that it is quite similar to Colorado in terms of outdoor enjoyment. I'm looking forward to some serious exploring and outdoor enjoyment...</p>
